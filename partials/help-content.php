                                <p>By adding some basic code to your website you will be able to empower your customers to share their purchases with their Facebook followers.</p>
                                <p>ShareitEffect will also allow you to offer your customers a small discount, once they post their purchase(s) on Facebook.</p>

                                    <li>Once your customer clicks on "Post to Facebook" the Facebook pop-up goes away and the customer remains on your website. The customer will immediately receive another pop-up with the discount code that will go toward their current purchase. A copy of the discount code will also be emailed to the customer.
