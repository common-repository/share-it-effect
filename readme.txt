=Do I need to close my website while the service is added to the backend? I don’t want to lose any potential shares during the update.=

No. The beauty of our platform means that you can add our service to your website without it having to shut down at all. The process is very simple and only takes about 30 minutes to set up. Our dashboard is very user-friendly with tutorials and step-by-step assistance. Plus, if needed our staff is happy to help answer any questions you have and even walk you through the setup process.

Great Question! Currently, we only integrate with Facebook, but this is subject to change at any time. In the future, we may offer other platforms as an option to post to.
        
=Does ShareitEffect work for companies that sell services and not products?=
                                
Yes, our proprietary solution is equally as great for companies selling services as it is for companies that sell products.
